This is an extension of Emacs aiming to enable Moldable Development.
Or better still, aiming to make you a better story teller when you
deal with code.

TODO: I will detail dependencies and more information in a later change.

*Ah! This is a pretty alpha release: I have a plan for quite few
changes ahead! So avoid to build upon this prototype for now!!*
